# Title: can AI simulate a human brain? (or can human brain be simulated with NN or DNN)  

## Abstract  
Human brain is a result of **evolution**, which was shaped by **variable** environment.  
why haven't we evolved such computation ability like computer, because we don't need it.  
reversly it has also something in common $\rightarrow$ there is some stuff in our brain,  
which we don't demand. Like the demand of adipose being related to starving for thousands of years.  
or kids require the intake of sugar.  
there are many higher organism own **similar basic network** structure. **Neural network**, which  
at least has been proved by ourselves, is a efficient way. But if it is the **global optimal solution  
of AI**, i doubt that.  
the following im gonna introduce some basic terms of NN, including **neuron**, the **signal Encoding** of NN,  
the main types of NN-structure: **DNN, CNN, RNN** , the way how they trainning and the memories/oblivion. 
above all compare with human brain in **neural science**, we'll see they have something in common but some other different.  
in conclusion, NN is a efficient structure, so when somebody get a good result by using this method/tool, i'm not  
surprising. But talking about Simulation, must try to be close to it. for this i'm not optimistic. Literally  
NN and human brain have something in common, but not to be called as Simulation, it is that we just find the same thought of solving a problem.
